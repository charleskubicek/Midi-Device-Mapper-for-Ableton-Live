This repository contains a MIDI mapping tool designed for Ableton Live, allowing for customised MIDI device mappings to Ableton live.

Mappings are made in a file between MIDI controls (buttons, sliders and controllers) and many Ableton functions.

Specific features include:

- **Multiple Modes**: Switch between various control modes, offering flexibility in device and track management.
- **User and Transport Functions**: Customizable user functions alongside transport controls like play, stop, and record.
- **Device and Track Navigation**: Directly navigate to named top-level devices or tracks by name.
- **Custom Encoder Ranges**: Define custom min/max ranges for encoder values for finer control.
- **Python Functions**; The ultimate customisation- call any function of the Ableton API combined with your own workflow logic!
